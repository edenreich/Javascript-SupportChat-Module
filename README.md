# Javascript-SupportChat-Plugin
This nice simple chat will take advantage of the socket.io libary

### Initialize the chat with your custom look.
```javascript
SupportChat.init({
  title: 'Support',
  titleColor: '#ffffff',
  event: 'send-message',
  background: '#009688',
});
```
### Create your chat.
```javascript
SupportChat.create();
```

## Please note: 
this chat-app is still in progress..so it's not yet fully functionally, if you wish to help get this going feel free to send me a pull request ! :)
